This is NOT the Nutcracker, nothing in common with the actual story. The actor who played 'The Nutcracker' really didn't suit the role, terrible acting.
The scene where Clara opened the music box for the first time and he was convincing her to stay, was so fake that make me laugh, and that was supposed to be an emotional moment!
Disney, I am really disappointed of he way you have interpreted this beautiful story.
To say something good about the film: the choice of actress of Clara was good and her acting was also good. And of course Keira Knightly was fantastic.
