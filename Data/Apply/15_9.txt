Sure to become a timeless holiday classic, this is a beautiful new adaption of the Nutcracker by Disney. The cinematography was beautiful and the acting was outstanding! Mackenzie Foy does an excellent job leading the movie and absolutely keeps up with the ever fabulous Kiera Knightly, Helen Mirren, and Morgan Freeman. With nods to the original story, ballet and even Fantasia- this is an adaption you won't want to miss. Follow Clara and the Nutcracker on their quest to determine if all you need to save the day is already inside of you.
Be forewarned that there are some creepy images including freaky clowns! (also dealing with parental death takes center stage!) But this is definitely a family friendly movie!
