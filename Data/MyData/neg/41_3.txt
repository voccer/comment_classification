This film simply doesn't work. However, with a major studio behind it there appears to have been an effort to spend their way out of trouble. Firstly the plot is boring and confusing and has no direction. It wanders aimlessly. The editing is all over the place with scenes stitched together and jumping about. The acting from some of the cast, particularly the Nutcracker, is embarrassing to watch. Thankfully Matthew MacFadyen provides much needed emotional gravitas as the father and Morgan Freeman and Helen Mirran are great scene stealers. Keira Knightleys also does her best she can with a poor script. There are great actors in this film such as Richard E. Grant who are criminally underused. Hopefully they were paid well. This film clearly took so long to make, probably due to reshoots, that you can see Mackenzie Foy getting older and then younger between scenes. This is a very poor addition to Disney's recent high quality live action films.This film simply doesn't work.
