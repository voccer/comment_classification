First off the acting was terrible . Thank god morgan freeman and Helen were on it even though they were really only in it for maybe 5 min each. Kiera was meh but the main girl her family and the nutcracker captain were terrible. It was like watching a horrible Junior high play .the special effects weren't even good you could tell it was green screened a lot of the time. The makeup looked like it was done by a two year old.
I mean I wasn't expecting a ton out of this film and still was very very disappointed .. don't bother if you were thinking of going .First off the acting was terrible .
