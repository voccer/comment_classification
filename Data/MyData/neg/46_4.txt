Had been excited to see this movie for months after seeing the trailers. As always, the trailer depicted a completely different movie. This reminded me a lot about the mess that was Snow white and the huntsman. Super boring, almost no action, anti climatic and little character development. The visuals were great at least. All in all, was super bored.Had been excited to see this movie for months after seeing the trailers. As always, the trailer depicted a completely different movie.
