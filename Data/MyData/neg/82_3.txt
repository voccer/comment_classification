Took my step daughter to see this. Even she was bored.
Disney has really missed an opportunity with this film. There is no life to it, no chemistry, no character development. It thinks it's clever but it really isn't. The CGI is poor, the acting is wooden. I was bored from the beginning to the end. Nothing made any sense whatsoever. You didn't really see two of the four realms and there was never any real explanation about what happened to the fourth realm. The "twist", so to speak, was the most predictable thing ever. The nutcracker soldier was just a bit part and not really particularly important. The whole thing was just a massive let down. Could have been something on an epic scale but it was just generic Disney fodder. It will be forgotten in a couple of months. So, so disappointing.
