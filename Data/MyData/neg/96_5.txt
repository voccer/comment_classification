I was so excited to go see this movie, only to be let down! Anyone 10 and under will probably enjoy it. Much of the acting was predictable ans mundane.
The enjoyable moments included 2 styles of dance. The genres of ballet and a twist on hip hop provided some temporary interest. I'd wait for this one to come to the small screen.
