We saw the movie tonight and while we both found it entertaining, I was disapointed in the fact that there was only a few bars of Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky music. I was really looking forward to hearing most of the score. Also, I am tired of the leftist Hollywood types slipping leftist symbols into Childrens Fairy Tales. I must say Disney did conspire with the Russians on set and costume design and I was really impressed with both the sets and costums and the use of the Katuska Doll characters. Colors were pretty. And the movie dragged....I think for P.I.T. music would have give it a holiday, uplifting, magic feeling.
