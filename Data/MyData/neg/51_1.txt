I could go on for ages to give reasons why this film was a total disaster and not only because of my passion of the original story, the ballet, the music I'm in love with, but because from a film-production / creation point of view. I was so bored about the story that it totally killed my enthusiasm of waiting for a twist to come...when I ACTUALLY had like a 3-4 minutes flash of having seen something better (the disturbing clowns from the circus tent - they were so morbid and bullying that at least it made me feel something about the film for a short time) I turned to my boyfrined and said: "you know what, maybe, it is not THAT bad eventually"...he said opening his eyes: "what? why? I fall asleep..." and then I continued to be bored...
-"We will protect the realm!"...against what? the original plot?
it is so slow and uncreative that it hurts because we've been waiting for this film to come out for a year, the trailer seemed super exciting but I never had the feeling of being entertanied or be in a flow.-the nachos were good.I could go on for ages to give reasons why this film was a total disaster and not only because of my passion of the original story, the ballet, the music I'm in love with, but because from a film-production / creation point of view.
