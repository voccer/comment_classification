Huge disappointment. The acting was amateurish. Not even Helen Mirren could save the movie. Morgan Freeman in his usual "I am wiser than anyone else" role. The composer of the music believed he could do better job than Tchaikovsky.
Aside from bad story, directing and acting, the 3D was distorted, the effects were cheap and obvious, the picture was bleak and smeared. Colours muddy and dark. Total disaster. I will think twice before I go to see another Disney fantasy movie.
