1 of the best parts about 'The nutcracker and the 4 realms' is the actual ballet, filmed on Misty Copeland and team in 3D, that forms a ('an' inorganic) part of the movie (plus, at the end).Prod design is top-notch.
Music predictable, but decent.
Casting good, performances average (McFadyen is fantastic, as always)....Overall, other than a few positives, and the ballet sequences, both during the movie, and during the end-credits - meh.But viewing the ballet sequences are worth the price of admission....go figure.Most of the other things about the movie are missed opportunities, and as such, forgettable.1 of the best parts about 'The nutcracker and the 4 realms' is the actual ballet, filmed on Misty Copeland and team in 3D, that forms a ('an' inorganic) part of the movie (plus, at the end).Prod design is top-notch.
