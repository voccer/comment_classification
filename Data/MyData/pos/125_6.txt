The Nutcracker and The Four Realms is based on the ballet on The Nutcracker and stars Mackenzie Foy from Twilight Breaking Dawn Part 1 and 2 and tells the story of a young girl named Clara who goes off on an adventure to find the missing key which opens a mysterious gift that she got for Christmas from her deceased mother. She teams up with the nutcracker and meets an overbearing fairy called The Sugar Plum Fairy played by Kiera Knightly and sets out to defeat Mother Ginger played by Helen Mirren. But is Mother Ginger all that bad?
Overall the cinematography was beautiful to look at,the acting was ok I guess Kiera Knightly though irritated me in this film with her annoying accent and the story has alot of twists and turns. I was disappointed though and this maybe a spoiler that Clara ends up not being with the nutcracker in the end as I suppose since Kiera banned her daughter from watching The Little Mermaid and Cinderella where she quotes"I don't want my daughter to watch these simply because both women want the man to save them and that her daughter would except that men are all charming in real life. To me im 27 years old and I love fairytales and I got on OK in life.
If you are looking for a christmas movie then check it out. For me I felt I was watching a Tim Burton film with music from Danny Elfman(even though it was directed by the guy who brought you Jumanji 1995).Its an OK movie but its nothing spectacular. My advice go watch A Star Is Born instead.
