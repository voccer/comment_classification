It's awesome! The ending is so surprising: I thought the character "Mother Ginger" was the villain when I first saw the trailer, but she is not. Besides, the villain is the character "Sugar Plum". In conclusion, this is a very meaningful movie, so I suggest you to go to the theater to watch it.It's awesome!
