Yes the visuals are the only thing going for it but beneath that layer is a pretty good story about a girl not willing to accept her reality . Foy really transcends in this and the camera loves her she's bound for stardom. As for the main powerhouse Kiera Knightley really knocked it out it of he park , she gives one of the most bizarre yet unique performances of the year. She's clearly having a good time and it shows she definitely makes the picture for me . Miran is ok very underused. Jayden Fowora-Knight on the other hand is another star I hope to see more of in the future just a brilliant actor. Overall yeah the four realms is a Christmas Alice but if you're willing to give it a chance you might find a new gem to watch every year.Yes the visuals are the only thing going for it but beneath that layer is a pretty good story about a girl not willing to accept her reality .
