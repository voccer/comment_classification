Just watched this with my movie theatre-working friend. We both enjoyed this adaptation of the various "Nutcracker Suite"s on film from the Disney company. It involves a young girl who lost her mother and is distant from her father and siblings when they go to a party. Then she experiences an adventure that may change her for the good. Because of some set pieces, it's not always easy to understand what's going on but it never lags in energy so there's that. So on that note, The Nutcracker and the Four Realms is good, not great entertainment.
