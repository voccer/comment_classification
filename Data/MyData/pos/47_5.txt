A young girl is transported into a magical world of gingerbread soldiers and an army of mice. The Nutcracker and the Four Realms is visually stunning, well acted and is based upon a very well known and beloved fairy tail so why did it suck? Well you see everything was rushed in it from the storyline, to the pacing to it's characters themselves. The Sugar Plum Fairy twist was bad, Morgan Freeman and Helen Mirren got wasted and despite the efforts of everyone? It just doesn't feel like a Nutcracker story neither in the heart or the soul and it just disappointed me.A young girl is transported into a magical world of gingerbread soldiers and an army of mice.
