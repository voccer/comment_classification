I feel like a lot of love went into this movie. The visuals are beautiful, which was mainly what I was looking for when I decided to see it. The costumes, the appearance of the realms... all beautiful! Kiera Knightley's performance is a lot of fun. I enjoyed seeing her as the giggly Sugar Plum Fairy instead of the more serious roles she typically plays. The movie contained a diverse cast in a way that wasn't distracting, including an appearance by ballerina Misty Copeland. I'll admit that some parts were rather cliche and predictable, but it's also a "family film," so I try to keep in mind that they're not really going for subtlety. As a warning to people with children, a few minor characters are a little creepy-looking, such as weird clown-things and expressionless toy soldiers. Overall, I found it to be a sweet movie with some heartwarming messages, and very pretty to look at!I feel like a lot of love went into this movie.
