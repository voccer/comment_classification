I saw this movie as a PremEar in 3D at the Disney Wonder, a Disney Cruise ship on November 1. My opinion is.... Well good but not really as great as I wanted it to be. It does have some good action and characters but what's really great about the movie is the score. I thought it was good, especially that Disney logo reorchestration. The way they depict the Four Realms is beautifully designed, especially the castle in the center of it all.All in all, I gave it an 8/10. You would either watch it on a Disney Cruise or on the Streaming Service.I saw this movie as a PremEar in 3D at the Disney Wonder, a Disney Cruise ship on November 1. My opinion is....
