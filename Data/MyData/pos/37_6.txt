I have been waiting and very excited to see it. I walked away with mixed feelings about the movie. It started out great, then at one point it felt very cheesy, then had more great parts, then back to cheesy. The visuals were fantastic, some of the acting, not so much. It felt as though they had a large production budget and then hired amateurs to direct and edit the movie. It was very odd. If you love the Nutcracker, you should see it.....just maybe at home and not the theater.I have been waiting and very excited to see it. I walked away with mixed feelings about the movie.
