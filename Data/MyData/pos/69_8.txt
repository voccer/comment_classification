Still the best part of this movie is Tchaikovsky's music. The best performers were Morgan Freeman and Kiera Knightly. I know the young Clara is getting all the publicity but she is just OK. I think there was supposed to be a relationship between Clara and the young captain/nutcracker, but I just did not see it.
