I loved "Nutcracker" and found the naysayers and critics to be wrong in their opinions about the plot and acting. Mackenzie Foy is very believable in her grief and also in her love of figuring things out. The plot is very mesmerizing and I found that contrary to what "Rotten Tomatoes" and other sites say, not convoluted or confusing at all. I loved the twists at the end and also how Clara found strength in herself and ability to do the right thing. I hope moviegoers will decide for themselves to see this movie as it it perfect for the holidays, and not let someone else decide for them!I loved "Nutcracker" and found the naysayers and critics to be wrong in their opinions about the plot and acting.
