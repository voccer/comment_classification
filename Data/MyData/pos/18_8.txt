I saw this movie tonight after much anticipation. Yes I read and heard the negative commments, however, I never base seeing a movie on them. What do I look for in any film, well a few things such as...believability, set construction, costumes, attention to detail, story, the point of the story, character chemistry, and the ebb and flow fo the story. The set and costumes are magnificently done. In close ups the attention to detail is spot on. The story does not try to be what the original ballet is about. Instead it gave you a different look at a familiar story. If you look at the film for what it was then believability was there. It's a fairy tale, which means nothing is real so anything can be real. The point of the story is to show a young lady who has suffered a loss that all is not really ever lost its always with you and in doing so it helps to bring a suffering family together. It takes this young lady to go onto a fanciful journey to understand how to look for something that is not right in front of your eyes and see it. I gave it an 8 because it did spend too much time in places which slowed the momentum and the flow of the story. Also there were a few confusing spots. All in all it is a good family film that is light and reminds us all that even though we suffer loss and feel pain your re stronger than you think and those we loose are never lost they are always around inside each of us. This is a good thought for Christmas and any time of the year. I feel an Oscar nomination should be given for the set designs and costumes. The were beyond amazing!
