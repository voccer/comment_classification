I was so sceptical to see this film, BUT I am glad I did.
There are a few characters I didnt like but I wont mention it as that's my own opinion.BUT over all the film was so enhancing and magical and such a beautiful story it truly has me gripped from start to finish I didnt take my eyes of the screen and sad when finished!
beautiful and overall a great film rated an 8 because of certain characters I didnt find enjoyable.GO SEE!I was so sceptical to see this film, BUT I am glad I did.
