This movie beautifully intertwines Pyotr Illych Tchaikovsky's "The Nutcracker" ballet with E.T.A. Hoffman's short story, "The Nutcracker and the Mouse King." Mackenzie Foy does a stellar job with the lead role and is supported by a masterful cast. The visual effects produce a believable world and the storyline places an interesting twist to characters that we know and love in The Nutcracker. James Newton Howard seamlessly makes the soundtrack flow between the familiar Tchaikovsky and and the new narrative of the movie.
