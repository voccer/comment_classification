Well, where do i start again? I always love disney movie, i do. And i have waited for this one movie to play. It was beautiful, and yet too lame. At first i was thinking to my self 'is this alice in wonderland or what' seeing how she enter the magical world and then met all that unique person and all that, i don't know, clown? And i was like okay, lets just wait. I do not see the cast, all i know is that mckenzie foy is in this movie. So i was just waiting for the nutracker to finally show himself. For the half of the movie. And never find him until the end of the movie. If you mean the nutracker is that doll army, than it just destroying the story i know. There is no prince eric who then cursed and then change into nutracker. It definitely not the nutracker you know from your childhood. It just clara in wonderland.
