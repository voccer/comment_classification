All the hate you are seein, is from grownups complaining about a movie made for children. Good grief, shut the f up.My kids loved it and I found it enjoyable, maybe it is because I am still a child at heart allowing me to still enjoy the fantastic. Go watch this with your kids, sit back, shut up, and remember it is just a kids movie.And please, please, don't bore anyone with criticisms of a kiddy movie. It will just make you sound childish.
