I suspect From reading various reactions to NutCracker the Four Realms that I'm in the minority of movie goers who enjoyed this film .I'm ok with that in fact it pleases me when I go against the trend of what other people try to tell me what is good entertainment.
It may not even make anywhere near its huge Production costs of 120 million $'s judging from the reviews and poor reception .I found it enchanting , reminding me of Pantomimes that I went to see as a child. It's an old fashioned and yet original take on the much loved Christmas Classic of The Nutcracker.At times very humorous bordering on Camp humour , especially when Sugar Plum played by Keira Knightly turns (I was glad as she was irritating me a little being so sweet)
Helen Mirren gives a delightful performance as Mother Ginger and Mackenzie Foy is delightful as Clara.
I thought they should have used more of the talent and humour of Jack Whitehall as Harlequin and Omid Djalili as Cavalier they had some of the funniest moments in a film that does have a few slow spots in the first half but they're needed to set the plot.Lasse Halstrom directed Chocolat, on of my favourite movies and I can see similarities in this film , go with an open mind you may enjoy it.Great music and 3G scenery not a classic like The Wizard of Oz but some of the same old fashioned magic. I thought it far superior to Fantastic Creatures and the Crimes of Grindelwald also showing at the moment and getting a much better reception , it's all a matter of personal taste and I imagine all at Disney are hoping for a huge hit and better reception for Mary Poppins Returns,I don't think they need to worry.
