This movie is worth a higher rating so here it is.I give it a 10 for the images, the costumes, the actors, and the imaginary world superbly created.The story is obviously not a blockbuster, it is childish. I had no expectation when I saw the movie, it was probably aimed for children between 6 to 10. Given this, I think it's perfect!Just enjoy what you see.
