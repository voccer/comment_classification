In March 2018, Disney released one of the most stupid, boring, painful, ludicrous, forgettable movie they have ever been involved in. That dumpster fire was "A Wrinkle in Time."Disney had a chance to redeem itself with their newest movie "The Cracking Nuts and the blah blah blah."It is a kinda but not too boring movie with visuals ranging from pretty to hideous, and the acting is decent, except for one lady who talks like an annoying 16 year old girl. There is also very little humanity in the characters, and when there are emotional scenes, it feels sorta plastic.The story was pretty good, a major improvement over the nasty Wrinkles, and there was very good acting from the characters, especially the lead role.Very nice visuals sometimes, but some CGI looks like vomit of the color spectrum. The film is not very good at being humorous as well. Not a memorable film in general, but not a terrible one indeed.At least it is light years ahead of "A Wrinkle in Disney's filmography."Score: 5/10
