Imagine you're at a funeral. You see the person in the coffin, all prettied up with makeup, and they look great. But they are also lifeless and dead. And even with all the makeup on them, you still know there is no soul there. Congratulations, you've now seen THE NUTCRACKER AND THE FOUR REALMS.But God, I wish this was just a lifeless movie. It's also bland, boring, poorly written, cheesy, predictable as hell, and did I say boring? There are two things that were good in this movie: the music and the production design/the look of the movie. But, they didn't write this music (obviously) and even while the movie looked great, you just could tell almost everything was fake.I had no expectations of this movie being good, but what I wasn't expecting was how apparent it would be that nobody behind this movie had any passion with this idea. You can almost guarantee nobody came to them with a dream idea for a movie, somebody approached someone else and said "Make a Nutcracker movie." Which is fine, but damn put some effort in it.Ugh.
