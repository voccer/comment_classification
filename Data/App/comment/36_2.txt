There's potential here for a wonderful movie! I found this movie DESIRING to be a cross between "Alice in Wonderland" and "The Chronicles of Narnia"...but alas, the movie just fell flat. For young viewers, this movie can be quite scary at times. The Mouse King - actually a writhing body of mice all working together as one moving mass - is the stuff of children's nightmares. For older viewers, there's very little storyline here. It's way too politically correct, while the emotional bonds between ALL the characters just felt thin and scripted. I wish I could say something positive about this movie, but unfortunately this Nutcracker will NOT be a classic.
