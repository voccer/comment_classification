Loved it, every second of it. It's just sad to me to see so many poor reviews from critics. I would think they would have eaten this up. It's a truly scrumptious, beautifully made film & veritable feast for the eyes.I've loved the Nutcracker story since I was a little girl & have seen the full ballet a few times as well as most every version made for TV & on film over several decades. This version is absolutely spectacular & the best as far as I'm concerned.Keira Knightley & Helen Mirren were fantastic as Sugar Plum & Mother Ginger. Mackenzie Foy did a wonderful job as Clara, I've never seen her before & am looking forward to seeing her in her future endeavors. Jayden Fowora-Knight was impressive in his first real role as the "Nutcracker" named Phillip. I hope he gets the chance for more & better roles.Lasse Hallström did a great job directing along with Joe Johnston.The reimagined storyline by Ashleigh Powell is definitely different than any I've seen before & I really liked it.& finally, James Newton Howard took the phenomenal score written for the Russian ballet, "The Nutcracker" by Tchaikovsky, & wove it into a beautiful score for this movie.I say see it on the big screen if you can, it's just absolutely gorgeous & downright magical. I don't believe it'll be appreciated as much by small children, though, but older children should & definitely old kids like me.
