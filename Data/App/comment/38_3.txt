Despite knowing that Keira Knightly is to acting what Jeremy Corbyn is to Grand Opera I ponied up at the Box Office having failed to make even a cursory check and so under the impression that if nothing else my ears would be in for a treat via the ballet music. Boy, did I get a wrong number. What I did get - during the time I wasn't actually asleep was a fakokta from which Disney may well never recover. Appalling, atrocious - and that's only the A's. Luckily I wasted less than two hours which I'll still never get back.
