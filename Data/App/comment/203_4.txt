Okay, so I wasn't excited to see it but I did go in with an open mind. This movie was just there. It's as if they combined every "fantasy" Disney movie and combined it into one and slapped a title that deals with Christmas. To me, that made it a mess. Plus, I don't think they should have called it "The NUTCRACKER and the four realms" he was just a minor character that helped the girl.
