Overall - it's a visually compelling film and is worth checking out for a new holiday treat.However - as filmmaking goes, the story itself is a tad flat. Most of the characters were one-dimensional and the tension didn't build up enough to expand the story. Lots of potential, but little delivery. Great stars with great visuals, low drama, low payoff.
